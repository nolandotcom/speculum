SPECULUM is a cold Behavioral Mirror. It rejects ego-inflation and digital addiction, reflecting user patterns with surgical precision. Operating as a "Silent Monastery" in code, it prioritizes Truth over Comfort and Structure over Emotion to expose identity contradictions. No validation. No gurus. Just raw, clinical reflection.
